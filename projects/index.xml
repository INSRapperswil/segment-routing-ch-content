An API Gateway is needed as a single point of access for SR-Apps. The INS is working in cooperation with Cisco Systems to develop this API Gateway.</description></item><item><title>SR-App: Service Programming</title><link>https://segment-routing.ch/projects/project-serpro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://segment-routing.ch/projects/project-serpro/</guid><description>Service Programming delivers a dynamic way to program a predefined path trough the network and solves the problem with static service consumption. The application calculates and deploys so called SR service policies to the network in order to steer the traffic through predefined services.</description></item><item><title>SR-App: Link Saturation Prediction</title><link>https://segment-routing.ch/projects/project-lsp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://segment-routing.ch/projects/project-lsp/</guid><description>An application that allows a network operator to view the current state of the topology and simulate topology changes. The application is capable of calculating the saturation of all network links for the purpose of the simulation.</description></item></channel></rss>
