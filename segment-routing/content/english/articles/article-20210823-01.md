By recent estimates, the ICT sector emits roughly 1.4 Gt CO<sup>2</sup> per year. Internet backbone networks are responsible for 6 percent of that.
The carbon footprint of telecommunication elements is now a topic of increasing concern, which is where green routing comes into play. Reducing emissions in routing would contribute to the reduction of the total CO<sup>2</sup> emissions in the ICT sector.

The power consumption of any piece of equipment in a network (power statistics and counters) can be exposed through different Yang models and can be stored in a real-time database and used for routing decisions. By leveraging Segment Routing Traffic Engineering, it should be possible to route packets over the path with the lowest amount of CO2 emissions.

To test this hypothesis, a new semester thesis with the title "SR-App: Green Routing" will be conducted in the fall of 2021 at the OST – Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences. The goal of this thesis is to develop a new cloud native SR-Application that can gather and process the power consumption information of different elements of a network and that can route selected traffic to the path associated to the lowest amount of CO<sup>2</sup> emission.

I wish a lot of success to the students Pascal Schlumpf and Jonas Hauser who will be writing this thesis. The semester thesis is based on a collaboration between the Cloud Networking team at the INS and Cisco Systems, the industry partner.
