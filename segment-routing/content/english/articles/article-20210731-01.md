The INS has submitted a contribution to the <a href="http://www.cnsm-conf.org/2021/workshop_NetP.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first international workshop on Network Programmability (NetP)</a> to be held in conjunction with 17th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM), Izmir, Turkey on the October 25-29 2021.  

Our paper describes an application for dynamic service programming with an original optimized path processing (with pre-processing).  The application is running at the INS as a proof-of-concept with a virtual lab environment running SRv6-aware services.
This paper is a collaboration between Cisco Systems and INS, the authors being <a href="ins/about-us/laurent-metzger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laurent Metzger</a>, <a href="ins/about-us/julian-klaiber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julian Klaiber</a> and <a href="ins/about-us/severin-dellsperger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Severin Dellsperger</a> on the INS side and François Clad and Ahmed Abdelsalam on the Cisco side. 

Obviously, we hope that our paper is going to be accepted. We will be notified about it on September 7 2021. Papers accepted and presented at NetP will be published open access on the conference Web site with IFIP copyright, and will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore, ACM and IFIP Digital Libraries.
