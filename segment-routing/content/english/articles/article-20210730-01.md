The Cloud Networking team at INS is going to collaborate with the research team of Professor Stefano Salsano at the <a href="https://en.uniroma2.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Roma Tor Vergata</a> on a project called **Extending K8s with SRv6 features**. 

The university of Roma has already modified the Calico plugin to support the SRv6 encapsulation and they are now looking to use the features of SRv6 (L3 VPN, SR-TE, Service Programming) within the Kubernetes cluster. A very important use case is also to integrate Kubernetes with external networks. The vision would be to implement end-to-end SRv6 encapsulation from the PE to the services in the Kubernetes cluster.

At the time of writing, the collaboration is being built and the first exchange of information has taken place. 

We are looking forward to contributing to that innovation, the goal being to co-author some scientific papers on that subject.
