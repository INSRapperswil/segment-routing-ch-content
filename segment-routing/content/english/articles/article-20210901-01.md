The INS has made a second paper contribution to the <a href="http://www.cnsm-conf.org/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)</a> in Izmir, Turkey, on October 25-29, 2021.

The paper describes the functionalities and features of the <a href="https://www.segment-routing.ch/projects/project-serpro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SerPro</a> application. A short insight is given on how the application is built and deployed. The paper aims to get a demo slot and introduce the application to a larger audience. The paper was written by the Institute for Networked Solutions, with contributions from <a href="ins/about-us/julian-klaiber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julian Klaiber</a>, <a href="ins/about-us/laurent-metzger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laurent Metzger</a>, and <a href="ins/about-us/severin-dellsperger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Severin Dellsperger</a>.

If the paper is accepted, we will have the opportunity to present <a href="https://www.segment-routing.ch/projects/project-serpro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SerPro</a> at the <a href="http://www.cnsm-conf.org/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNSM</a> and thus represent the Institute for Networked Solutions at a major event. We will be informed about the acceptance of the paper in mid-September 2021.
