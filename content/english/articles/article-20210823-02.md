The INS in cooperation with Cisco Systems have recently developed several segment routing applications and have several more in planning for the coming months.

A new semester thesis with the title "Central Frontend for Segment Routing Applications" will be conducted in the fall of 2021 at the OST – Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences. The goal of this thesis is to build the central frontend that is the entry page for all SR-Apps.

The landing page will display a near real-time topology of the service provider network. Because these networks are usually very large, some intelligent features like for example clustering and zooming should be introduced for a better usability.

In the Jalapeño data collection framework developed by Cisco, the nodes and links are already exposed to a collector through different Yang models. A new collection for the coordinates will have to be added to the existing collector in order to be able to place the telecommunication equipments on the map.

I wish a lot of success to the students Leonard Obernhuber and Davor Gajic who will be writing this thesis. The semester thesis is based on a collaboration between the Cloud Networking team at the INS and Cisco Systems, the industry partner.
